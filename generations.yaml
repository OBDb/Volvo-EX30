    description: "The Volvo EX30 is Volvo's smallest electric SUV, introduced in 2023 as part of the brand's ambitious electrification strategy. Built on Geely's Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA), the same platform underpinning the Smart #1, it combines Volvo's Scandinavian design philosophy with compact dimensions and full electric power. The exterior features a distinctive interpretation of Volvo's design language, including Thor's Hammer headlights, a closed-off grille, and a boxy yet modern silhouette, measuring just over 4.2 meters in length. The EX30 is offered with multiple powertrain options, including single-motor rear-wheel drive variants with either a 51 kWh LFP battery (approximately 344 km WLTP range) or a 69 kWh NMC battery (approximately 480 km WLTP range), and a dual-motor all-wheel drive performance version producing around 428 horsepower with a 0-100 km/h time of 3.6 seconds. The interior presents a minimalist approach with a single 12.3-inch central touchscreen controlling most functions, no traditional instrument cluster, and a focus on sustainable materials including recycled plastics and textiles. Notable features include a Harman Kardon audio system, advanced driver assistance systems, and bidirectional charging capability on some variants. The EX30 represents Volvo's entry point into pure electric mobility, offering the safety, quality, and design expected from the brand in a more compact and accessible package, with a claimed carbon footprint that's the lowest of any Volvo vehicle to date."
